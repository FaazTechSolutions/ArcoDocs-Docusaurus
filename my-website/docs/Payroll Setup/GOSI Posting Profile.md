Handles the financial posting of GOSI contributions into the finance system.

### Key Features:

  - Uses a Posting Profile to map GOSI transactions to finance accounts.

### Posting Scenarios:

**1. Business Contracts**

  - GOSI transactions are posted together with the regular salary during payroll processing.

**2. Non-Business Working Employees**

  - GOSI transactions are posted along with the lodging salary (i.e., a separate salary for employees not on active projects but still receiving basic lodging pay).
