# Individual Payment Request

**Note :** Follows the same process and stages as the standard Payment Request.

  - Managed per employee or transaction individually, but:

    - Uses the same payment types (Bank Transfer, Cash, Cheque, Customer).

    - Proceeds through the same workflow stages (Approval, Import, Posting, Completed, Rejected).

    - Supports Bank Transfer feedback import and status updates like in bulk requests.
