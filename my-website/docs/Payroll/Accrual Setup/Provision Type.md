# Provision Type

Handles monthly transactions for provision-based employee benefits such as vacation, air tickets, and end-of-service (EOS).

### Purpose

  - To calculate and record monthly accruals for employee benefits.

  - To manage consumption of these benefits during clearance or exit.

### Accrual Transactions

  - **Monthly Accrual:** System automatically creates a positive transaction each month to accumulate provision amounts.

  - **Negative Accrual (Consumption):** Generated during benefit consumption or employee clearance (e.g., vacation taken, final settlement).

This reduces the accrued balance accordingly.

### Setup Configuration

**Provision Types**

You can define different types of provisions, such as:

  - Vacation Accrual
  - Air Ticket Accrual
  - End of Service (EOS) Accrual
