# GOSI Profile 

**GOSI (General Organization for Social Insurance)**

Manages social insurance contributions based on employee nationality and company setup.

**1. Nationality-Based Profiles**

  - Saudi
  - Non-Saudi

  Each profile determines how contributions are calculated and shared between company and employee.

**2. Configuration**

  - Define company and employee contribution percentages.

  - Configure GOSI calculation salary items (e.g., basic salary, housing allowance).

  - GOSI calculations are based on the active profile setup.

**3. GOSI Generation Triggers**

GOSI will be generated based on the active GOSI profile in the following scenarios:

  - When business payroll is generated (monthly salaries).

  - During final settlement (end-of-service processing).

  - By system schedule for active employees not part of business payroll (e.g., suspended projects or non-working assignments).
