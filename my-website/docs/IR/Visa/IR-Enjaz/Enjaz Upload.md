# Enjaz Upload

The Enjaz Upload process handles the import and tracking of visa stamping data from the Enjaz government system.

To Upload Enjaz, the following fields are mandatory,

  - Block Visa Number
  - Import Type
  - Enjaz Upload (File upload)

### 1. Data Import

  - User imports stamping data into the system.

  - This data is typically exported from the Enjaz website (official government portal).

### 2. Stamping Completion

  - Once data is imported, the system detects which entries have been successfully stamped.

### 2. Issue Visa Stamping

  - For entries marked as stamped, the system automatically proceeds to issue the visa stamping.

  - This finalizes the visa stamping record and links it to the related visa request or block visa.
