# Ewakala

The Ewakala module displays Ewakala records based on their current status. Records are organized into three distinct workflow stages:

### 1. Active

  - Displays all currently valid and active Ewakala.

  - These are authorizations that can still be used or assigned.

  - **Actions :**
    - **Cancel -**  Manually cancel the Ewakala.
Once cancelled, Moves to Cancel stage.

### 2. Cancel

  - Displays Ewakala records that have been cancelled.

  - These are no longer valid for visa use.

  - Usually cancelled by the user or system due to expiration, error, or request withdrawal.

### 3. Closed

  - Shows Ewakalas that are fully used and completed.

  - Indicates the authorization has served its full purpose (e.g., all visas issued).

  - No further action is needed or possible.
