# Iqama Renewal

## Renewal

- Manual Renewal requests are initiated by users or customers through the Case Management system.

- These requests are triggered based on the expiry date of employee documents (e.g., Iqama, ATM, Insurance).

- Once created, the Renewal request is managed in both Case Management and the HR system.

- The workflow stages and statuses are kept in sync across both systems using event-based configuration.
