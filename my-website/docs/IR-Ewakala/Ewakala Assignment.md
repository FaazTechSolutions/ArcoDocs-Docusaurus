# Ewakala Assignment

This is the process of assigning an Ewakala (authorization) to a visa case or recruitment workflow. There are two types of Ewakala processes, based on the platform used:

  1. Enjaz Ewakala
  2. Mussaned Ewakala

### 1. Enjaz Ewakala

Handled through the Enjaz system (used for general visa authorizations).

**Involves:**

  - Approval workflow
  - Creation in Enjaz
  - Payment
  - Under Process → Completed
  - Typically used for professional or corporate visa processing.

### 2. Mussaned Ewakala

Handled through the Mussaned platform (used for domestic labor recruitment).

  - Simpler flow, often includes:
  - Payment
  - Under Process → Completed
  - Tailored for household/domestic worker visa processing.

### Key Differences

**Platform:** Enjaz (corporate/professional), Mussaned (domestic/labor).

**Process Flow:** Enjaz includes more steps and tighter integration with government approvals; Mussaned is simpler and faster.

**Use Case:** Enjaz for companies and general recruitment; Mussaned for domestic recruitment agencies.

### Transfer Functionality

  - Users can create or transfer Ewakala (visa authorization).

  - Users can transfer Ewakala quantities to another demand letter, if:

    - The agent is the same.
    - The transfer respects the remaining balance.
