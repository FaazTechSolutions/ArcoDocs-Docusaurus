# Event History

The Event History module lets users track all triggered events and their status in one place.

### What It Does:

  - Shows a log of every event triggered in the system (like Email, SMS, API, or Document).

  - Displays the status of each event:

    - Success
    - Failed
    - Pending

### Key Features:

  - **Status Log –** Check whether an event was completed successfully or failed.

  - **Retry Option –** If an event failed (e.g., an email didn’t send), users can manually Retry it.
