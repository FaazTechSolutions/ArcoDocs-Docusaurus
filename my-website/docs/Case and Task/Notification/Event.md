# Event

The Event module lets you configure automatic actions in the system by linking Case Events to specific Activity Templates (Email, SMS, API, or Document).

  - Automatically sends notifications or triggers actions when certain case events occur.

  - Uses pre-defined Activity Templates for each action.

### Key Elements:

  - Event Name – Name of the case event (e.g., Visa Approved, Ticket Issued).

  - Case Type / Request Type – Choose which case or request this event applies to.

  - Trigger Stage – The workflow stage where the event should be triggered (e.g., Payment Completed).

  - Action Type – Select the type of action:

    - Email
    - SMS
    - API
    - Document

  - **Activity Template –** Select the related template to execute when the event occurs.
