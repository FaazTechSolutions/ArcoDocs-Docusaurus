# My Cases

> **Note :** The Workflows and Stage movements are same for all in the My Cases module like given below. Only the purpose and usability is different.

**My Cases Includes:**

  1. Created By Me
  2. Created By Team
  3. My Business Ticket
  4. My Individual Ticket
  5. My New Ticket

**1. Created By Me**

  - **Purpose:** These are cases that you, as the user, have personally created.

  - **Usability:** Helps you track your own tasks, ensuring you're managing everything you’ve initiated.

**2. Created By Team**

  - **Purpose:** Cases created by your team but requiring your attention or input.

  - **Usability:** Allows you to stay updated on tasks created by team members and maintain oversight.

**3. My Business Ticket**

  - **Purpose:** These are cases related to business operations or client-facing issues that you are responsible for.

  - **Usability:** Helps you manage and resolve business-critical issues like client complaints or operational concerns.

**4. My Individual Ticket**

  - **Purpose:** These tickets focus on individual-specific matters, such as candidate requests or personal tasks (e.g., passport issues, travel updates).

  - **Usability:** Helps you handle personal or candidate-related requests, ensuring everything is addressed in a timely manner.

**5. My New Ticket**

  - **Purpose:** This category includes new cases that you personally create—either for yourself or on behalf of others. It's a starting point for cases that are in the early stages of being worked on.

  - **Usability:** This category acts as the initial repository for all cases you create, allowing you to track, update, and close them as needed. It's perfect for managing tasks or requests that are still in their early stages.
