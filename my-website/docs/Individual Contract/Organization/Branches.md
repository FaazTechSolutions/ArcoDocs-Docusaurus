## Branch Lodging

### Purpose

Allows configuration of lodging facilities under a branch for delivery, transfers, and internal logistics.

### Lodging Setup Under Branch

For each branch, the following lodging configuration can be managed:

  - **Lodging**

The lodging facility associated with the branch.

  - **IsPrimary**

Marks the primary lodging used for delivery from this branch.

  - **Delivery Time**

Estimated or configured delivery time from this lodging.

### System Logic & Behavior

  - When a new branch is created, the system **automatically creates a new lodge** with **Lodge Type = "Branch"**.

  - The user must **map the branch to a lodging** that has **Lodge Type = "Branch"**.

  - The user can **update or change the primary delivery lodging** for any branch as needed.

### Internal Lodging Transfer

  - If an employee returns to a branch, the user can create an **Internal Transfer** in the **Lodging Module** to move the employee from the **Branch to Lodging**.

  - Once the **Labour Transfer** is completed, the employee is officially moved to the lodging facility.
