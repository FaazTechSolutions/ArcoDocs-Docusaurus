# Debit Note

## Purpose

A Debit Note is a financial record created by the Finance User to add a charge to a contract.

### How It Works

  1. Finance User starts a Debit Note Approval Process with the required details.

  2. Once approved, the Debit Note is generated.

### Debit Note Fields

Each Debit Note includes:

  - Invoice Number
  - Period
  - Value
  - Amount
  - Debit Note Expense Item
  - Voucher Subtype (for finance reference)
  - Tax Amount

### Payment Settlement

  - When the customer makes a payment, the system automatically settles the Debit Note via Invoice Settlement.
