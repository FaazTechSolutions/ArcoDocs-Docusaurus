# Transaction Reason

The Transaction Reason setup is used to define reasons for customer and labour transactions, such as contract cancellations, labour exchanges, check-ins, and check-outs. It helps in tracking and managing actions related to customers, employees, and vendors.

**Create Transaction Reason**

Users can create a transaction reason by entering the following details:

  - Relation Type
  - Customer Transaction Type
  - Labour Transaction Type
  - Description

After creating a transaction reason, users can edit, update, or delete it as needed.
