# Visa Stamping Enjaz

The Visa Stamping Enjaz process handles the integration of visa stamping data from the Enjaz selection process.

### 1. Data Selection

  - Users select the visa stamping data that needs to be processed from the Enjaz system.

  - This data typically includes applicant details, visa information, and stamping status.

### 2. Stamping Confirmation

  - Once the data is selected, the system checks the stamp status for each visa.

  - The system confirms whether each selected visa has been successfully stamped.

### 3. Finalize Visa Stamping

  - Once stamped, the system updates the visa records with the official stamping details (e.g., stamping date, visa number, etc.).
